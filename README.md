**Gameplay description**

###### Features:

Trampoline Ball is a 2D puzzle game. The goal of the game is to move a ball from its starting position to the finish hole only by drawing lines on the screen which function as trampolines. 
Different levels include different starting locations, different obstacles (walls) and different finish locations. 
Each level also includes 3 Stars which can be collected.
The player starts each level with 0 points and gets points added when he draws additional trampolines. The goal is to finish each level with as few points as possible while also collecting all 3 stars.

###### Controls:

The user can only draw the trampolines on the screen. When pressing play the ball then gets in motion and rolls/bounces automatically until it drops out of the playing area.

###### Graphics:

Currently i don't have any special graphics planned. The game area is going to be a white background and the trampolines are just black lines. An optional feature would be different themes for the background and the lines.

###### Optional:

Optional features include special levels with different gravity and differently shaped balls.
